# Screencast

## Project brief
I need a linux app that can do screen mirroring from existing or virtual monitors to other devices. So, I can utilize my iPad as a second monitor on the go.
Why? Because I linux is still lacking an app to do that so I better make one.

## Current State

 - [x] Start screen cast via XDG Desktop Portal (`create_screencast_session`)
 - [x] Open pipewire remote (`open_pipewire_remote`)
 - [ ] Stream pipewire to RTP

## Wishlist (Roadmap)
 - [ ] Stream protected content to RTP
 - [ ] Utilize VA-API
 - [ ] Remote control from Android/iPad
 - [ ] USB Connection
